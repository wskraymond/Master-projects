Why WSL?
WSL lets you run a Linux environment -- including command-line tools and applications -- directly on Windows, 
without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup. 
WSL especially helps web developers and those working with Bash and Linux-first tools 
(i.e. Ruby, Python) to use their toolchain on Windows and ensure consistency between development and production environments.

Why the WSL extension in VS Code?
With VS Code and the WSL extension combined, VS Codeâ€™s UI runs on Windows, 
and all your commands, extensions, and even the terminal, run on Linux. 
You get the full VS Code experience, including autocomplete and debugging, 
powered by the tools and compilers installed on Linux.

Getting started
You can launch a new instance of VS Code connected to WSL by opening a WSL terminal, navigating to the folder of your choice, and typing code .:

To get started with your first app using the WSL extension, check out the step-by-step WSL tutorial in docs:
