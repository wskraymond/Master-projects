int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);

=====> used to change the buffered mode and change the current buffer(given by kernel) to the user assigend one ( buf ).
The setvbuf() function may be used on any open stream to change its buffer. The mode argument must be one of the following three macros:

_IONBF
unbuffered

_IOLBF

line buffered

_IOFBF

fully buffered

-Except for unbuffered files, the buf argument should point to a buffer at least size bytes long; ****this buffer*** will be used instead of ***the current buffer****. 
-If the argument buf is NULL, only the mode is affected; a new buffer will be allocated on the next read or write operation.
